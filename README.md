## Code for Josh

Josh, you'll find the notebooks that we talked about, as well as the corpora that I use for the examples. The file structure should be fairly obvious, and easy to manipulate to fit your needs.

There are a few dependencies that you may not have installed, they are as follows:

1. [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)

2. [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

3. [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)

I reccomend installing them with a package installer, such as [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip?). You most likely already have pip installed. To double check that, open a terminal window, and type `pip`. You'll most likely get a bunch of information on pip and the arguments it accepts.

After you're up and running with the dependencies, simply download the repository, and run through the tutorials.
